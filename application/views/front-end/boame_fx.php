            <h4><b><b>ePlus FX</b></b></h4>
            <div>
                <p>Welcome to world of automated trading. <b>ePlus FX</b> is professionally crafted to execute trades and close them in profits only. Gone are the days of losses in forex. With our Expect Advisor, you can now trade without emotions or hassles.</p>
                <p>This tool can save traders from such an onerous task, and it comes in the form of forex robots or automated trading. This useful tool has become very popular, particularly in today’s busy world, and many traders are now taking advantage of a system that can do everything for them, apart from providing the necessary funds.</p>
                <p>Our automated forex trading is a system of trading foreign currencies with a computer program based on a set of analyses that help determine whether to buy or sell a currency pair at a given time. <b><b>ePlus FX</b></b> uses a computer program that the trader “teaches” to make decisions based on a set of technical rules. The signal generates an actual buy or sell order that is executed.</p>
                <p><b>ePlus FX</b> EA was primarily developed by leading analysts and expert programmers, who are responsible for coding different strategies into an automated system to open, manage, and close positions in the market with or without any human intervention.</p>
            </div>
            <h4><b>Awesome Features </b></h4>
            <div>
                <p>The design of <b>ePlus FX</b> is so easy to understand and install. Trades pick automatically and closes in profits. Just sit behind your computer and see profits. This is a scalper EA and works perfectly with all brokers</p>
                <p>With <b>ePlus FX</b>, you can bring a disciplined trading style, with proper stop loss for each trade, which will make your account more secure.</p>
                <p>Our friendly Help Team can be reached Monday through Friday, via WhatsApp chat and Email. All your queries will be responded within 24 hours</p>
            </div>
            <h4><b>Safeguard Yourself Against Market Upsets</b></h4>
            <div>
                <p>It’s pretty hard for traders to handle the market upsets based on news releases. However, <b>ePlus FX</b> handles more effectively such fluctuations and offer very precise indications. Thus a trader could stay immune from these harmful effects.</p>
                <p>The foremost advantage of using our forex robot is that it takes the emotional aspect out of trading. Our forex robot will execute the trade based on the settings of the user. It will make order regardless of minor deviation that may otherwise have confused even the most professional of forex traders. </p>
                <p><b>ePlus FX</b> will help the trader to avoid panic when making trading decisions. For instance, it will not close a trade based on a fear that the trading session opened a little higher or lower than usual. <b>ePlus FX</b> will help the trader to execute strategies based on pre-defined rules rather than pure emotion.</p>
                <p>As efficient as our trading robot used, its intelligence remains artificial. To the extent that it does not reflect on its own, it will be able to adapt to a changing market situation. Developing our automatic trading program is a major breakthrough for <b>Boame</b> and its one of our major products. During its creation, the issues it addressed do not have too much relationship with the trading itself but rather with research and development. </p>
                <p>Our automatic trading program is based on logic, so a logical strategy was developed so the program always know what to do.</p>
                <p>We recommend you use the most stable currency pair which is the <b>EURUSD</b>.</p>
            </div>
            <h4><b>Setting the Robot</b></h4>
            <div>
                <p>Ideally, you don’t need to do any setting on the robot again for best results. Minimum equity you need is $20,000 for cent or standard accounts. </p>
            </div>
            <h4><b>Broker</b></h4>
            <div>
                <p>Our recommended broker is weltrade. Get an account here <a href="https://weltrade.com/?r=ipartner&r2=6711"> https://weltrade.com/?r=ipartner&r2=6711</a>  </p>
            </div>
            <h4><b>Installing the Robot</b></h4>
            <div>
