        <h4><b>Safeguard Yourself Against Market Upsets</b></h4>
        <div>
            <p>It’s pretty hard for traders to handle the market upsets based on news releases. However, <b>ePlus FX</b> handles more effectively such fluctuations and offer very precise indications. Thus a trader could stay immune from these harmful effects.</p>
            <p>The foremost advantage of using our forex robot is that it takes the emotional aspect out of trading. Our forex robot will execute the trade based on the settings of the user. It will make order regardless of minor deviation that may otherwise have confused even the most professional of forex traders. </p>
            <p><b>ePlus FX</b> will help the trader to avoid panic when making trading decisions. For instance, it will not close a trade based on a fear that the trading session opened a little higher or lower than usual. <b>ePlus FX</b> will help the trader to execute strategies based on pre-defined rules rather than pure emotion.</p>
            <p>As efficient as our trading robot used, its intelligence remains artificial. To the extent that it does not reflect on its own, it will be able to adapt to a changing market situation. Developing our automatic trading program is a major breakthrough for <b>Boame</b> and its one of our major products. During its creation, the issues it addressed do not have too much relationship with the trading itself but rather with research and development. </p>
            <p>Our automatic trading program is based on logic, so a logical strategy was developed so the program always know what to do.</p>
            <p>We recommend you use the most stable currency pair which is the <b>EURUSD</b>.</p>
